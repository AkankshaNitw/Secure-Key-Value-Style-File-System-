# Secure-Key-Value-Style-File-System-
In this project a file system was implemented. This file system uses a flat key-value structure similar to GoogleFS to enable efficient sharing among multiple clients and uses MD5 algorithm to hash file names for security. FUSE 2.9.7. interface was used to interact with the kernel.
